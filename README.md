# Cryptodog

Cryptodog is a community-developed fork of the original Cryptocat browser extension, which was [discontinued in February 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160225040533/https://crypto.cat/).

We offer two things:

* A modified Cryptocat client, tweaked for security, performance, aesthetics, and usability
* A public, anonymous-login XMPP server (crypto.dog)

## Disclaimer
Like Cryptocat, Cryptodog is experimental software. It is suitable for educational and casual purposes only.

**Do not use Cryptodog if you have a critical need for anonymity or privacy.** This includes abuse victims, activists, journalists, sources, and citizens of oppressive countries.

If in doubt, use a vetted secure messenger like [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/).

## Usage

The recommended way to run Cryptodog is via our [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptodog/blnkmmamdbladdaaddkjbecbphngeiec) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cryptodog) extensions. Using our browser extension ensures you always have the official, most recent version.

If you just want to test out Cryptodog, we have a [client hosted on GitHub Pages](https://cryptodog.github.io).

## Bugs

Bug reports are encouraged! If you find a flaw in the Cryptodog client or server, please open an issue here on GitHub.

If you believe the issue is particularly sensitive with regard to security, we would appreciate *coordinated disclosure*. Please email us at security@crypto.dog.

Cryptodog is based on [version 2.2.2 of Cryptocat](https://github.com/Cryptodog/cryptocat/releases/tag/v2.2.2). While we have added security fixes and new features, the vast majority of changes are UI-related; neither the client cryptography nor server backend have been modified. However, this does not preclude Cryptodog from introducing vulnerabilities not present in Cryptocat.

For further details regarding Cryptodog's design, see the [Cryptocat Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20160216105404/https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/wiki).
