# Cryptodog

Cryptodog is a community-developed fork of the original Cryptocat browser extension, which was [discontinued in February 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160225040533/https://crypto.cat/).

We offer two things:

* A modified Cryptocat client, tweaked for performance, aesthetics, and usability
* A public server (crypto.dog)

## Differences from Cryptocat

* General and security bug fixes
* Dark theme with more contrast, easier on eyes
* Better tab-complete
* Faster loading
* Vector icons (better scaling on hiDPI displays and zoom levels other than 100%)
* Slight animation tweaks and additions
* Persistent ignore list
* Colored names in chat to improve readability
* Desktop notifications
* Unicode emoticons
* Easier localization

## Usage

The recommended way to run Cryptodog is via our [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptodog/blnkmmamdbladdaaddkjbecbphngeiec) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cryptodog) extensions. Using our browser extension ensures you always have the official, most recent version.

If you just want to test out Cryptodog, we have a [client hosted on GitHub Pages](https://cryptodog.github.io).

## Bugs

Bug reports are encouraged! If you find a flaw in the Cryptodog client or server, please open an issue here on GitHub.

If you believe the issue is particularly sensitive with regard to security, we would appreciate *coordinated disclosure*. Our security contact is security@crypto.dog, and you can find our PGP key [here](https://crypto.dog/security.asc).

## Security Caveats

Cryptodog is experimental software. It is suitable for educational and casual purposes only.

**Do not use Cryptodog if you have a critical need for anonymity and privacy**. This includes journalists, sources, activists, and citizens of oppressive countries.

### Technical

Cryptodog is based on version 2.2.2 of Cryptocat. The vast majority of changes are UI-related; neither the client cryptography nor server backend have been modified. However, this does not preclude Cryptodog from introducing vulnerabilities not present in Cryptocat.

For further details regarding Cryptodog's security model, see the [Cryptocat Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20160216105404/https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/wiki).
